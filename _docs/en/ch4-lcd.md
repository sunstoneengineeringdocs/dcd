The DCD320 allows the user to switch between CD and DC mode and adjust
two welding pulses in each mode. The energy or voltage is controlled with the
rightmost adjustment dial. The left most switch on the control panel allows
the user to toggle between DC and CD mode.

Messages are shown on the LCD display to indicated that a change is being
made to the welder. Here are a list of messages and what they indicate:

* ***DC MODE*** – Screen when unit switch to DC mode
* ***4.0 V*** – In DC mode the weld power is adjusted via the voltage setting. The voltage can be adjusted by 0.1 volt increments.
* ***Pulse 1 Screen[1-> 2ms]; Pulse 2 Screen [2-> 70 ms]*** – Pulse one and two can be adjusted at any time. The pulses display milliseconds of on time down to 1ms and up to 750ms (pulse 2). Each pulse can be turned off by adjusting the length down to zero ms
* ***Screen 1[2-> 46 ms]; Screen 2 [2-> 100 ms]*** – To help increase the ease of weld setting adjustment pulse widths below 50ms will adjust by 1ms increments. Above 50ms the pulse width will adjust by 10ms increments.
* ***CD MODE*** – Screen when unit switch to CD mode
* ***Screen 1 [48 WS]; Screen 2 [55 WS]*** – In CD mode the welder is adjusted via the energy stored in watt-seconds (ws). The energy is adjusted by 0.1ws increments below 15ws, by 1ws increments from 15 - 50ws, and by 5ws increments from 50 - 320ws
* ***Screen 1 [1 -> OFF]; Screen 2 [1 -> 0.04ws]*** – Pulse one and two can be adjusted at any time, and display ws of energy that will be discharged in each pulse. The pulses can also be turned off by adjusting the pulse energy down to zero ws.
* ***Screen 1 [2-> 0.94ws]; Screen 2 [2-> 14.7ws]; Screen 3 [2-> 15ws]*** – Pulse 1 and 2 adjust by 0.05ws below 1ws. From 1 to 15 ws the pulse width is adjusted by .1ws increments. From 16 to 50ws the pulse width adjusts by 1ws increments. Above 50ws adjustment takes place by 5ws increments.
