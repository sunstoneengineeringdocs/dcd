##### QUICK START SET UP OF CDDP ROLL SPOT HAND ATTACHMENT

The roll spot upgrade allows users to perform a continuous string of welds
for any prolonged time period – for as long as the trigger signal is maintained
actuated. The roll spot function requires a special hand-piece that is
designed specifically for roll spot welding.

1. Remove the Roll Spot Attachment from its package.
2. Connect the Roll Spot cable to either of the terminals on the front of the welder and the grounding clip cable to the other terminal. Then attach the trigger cable to the back of the welder.
3. Plug the welder power cable into an AC power outlet.
4. Turn the welder on and set the desired energy settings.
5. Switch from the standard “CD” mode to the “Roll Spot” (RS) mode. The RS mode alters the trigger and timing configurations of the welder. See details below.
    1. The Pulse On/Off switch, which normally would turn the weld function on/off, has been re-purposed to switch between Single Fire (SF) and Roll Spot (RS) modes – thus, the welds cannot ever be turned off while the welder is still on.
    2. In RS mode, the system has an adjustable “between-weld” delay that affects the frequency or rate of welding while a trigger signal is maintained.
    3. In RS mode, the system only performs a single pulse weld at each weld spot.
    4. The system no longer has the ability to turn welds off while in RS mode. If the welder is turned on, the welder is active and will weld if a trigger signal is sent to the welder.
    5. In SF mode, the unit will weld once per trigger signal.
    6. While in SF mode, all dials and interface options (aside from the pulse on/off switch) will operate the same as on the standard, nonupgraded, base model welder.
    7. In RS mode, however, the device will continuously weld at an adjustable rate for as long as the trigger signal is maintained. If using a foot pedal, the welder will continue to weld for as long as the foot pedal is depressed. If using a pressure actuated and piece, the welder will continue to weld for as long as the pressure actuated switch is engaged.
    8. In RS mode, two variables will affect the time between each weld. The first is an adjustable minimum weld delay that can be set by the operator. This is accomplished by turning the “Pulse 1” dial on the front of the welder. The second factor is the recharge time between welds. This is determined based on the energy setting. The higher the weld energy, the longer the delay between welds will be.
    9. In RS mode, the “Pulse 2” dial is used to select the total weld time of each individual weld that takes place during the RS welding process.
