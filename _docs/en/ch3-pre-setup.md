##### VOLTAGE AND POWER REQUIREMENTS

Sunstone Capacitive Discharge Dual Pulse (CDDP) welders are equipped
with universal power supplies and can be used with both 110/220V AC wall
power. No voltage selection is required prior to connecting and powering
on the welder. The welder will detect the voltage, and make the appropriate
adjustments automatically.

##### WELD ACTUATION

The CDDP welders are actuated by means of an external trigger port located
on the back of the welder (see *Figure 7*). The trigger uses a DIN 3 connector
and requires shielded wire. *Figure 7* shows the proper pin placement for
custom external trigger cables. The standard external trigger cable connector
is an SD-30LP made by CUI Inc.

##### WELDER BEEPS

Sunstone CDDP welders are equipped with a beeper. When enabled, the
welder will beep when the unit has reached its targeted weld energy. This
signifies that the unit is ready to weld. Users can turn Welder Beeps on or off
with a switch located on the back of the welder.

##### THERMAL PROTECTION

Sunstone capacitive Dual Pulse welders are equipped with temperature
sensors. If the unit is close to overheating, the operator will hear six
successive beeps and will not be able to weld during this time. When the unit
has cooled, the operator will hear three successive beeps, signifying that the
unit is again ready to weld. (*These warning beeps will still occur even if the
“Welder Beeps” option is turned off.) To ensure proper cooling, the welder
flow paths shown in *Figure 8* should be unobstructed. Please maintain a clear
space of 6+ inches around the welder vents.
