##### DUAL PULSE WELDING

Sunstone Dual Pulse welders have two pulse width energy controls. The blue
back-lit LCD displays each pulsesâ€™ percent of total stored energy and the
total stored energy in Joules (J). Each pulse can be adjusted separately or
turned off if desired. Both pulses can be turned off without adjusting pulse
values to facilitate weld attachment setup or electrode maintenance. Pulse 1
is adjustable between 1% and approximately 30% of the total stored energy.
Pulse 2 is adjustable between 1% and 99% of the stored energy. Please note
that when used in dual pulse mode the Pulse 2 energy level represents the
percent of remaining power. For example if Pulse 1 was set to 25% the Pulse
2 setting would actually be taken from the remaining 75% of the set-point
energy.

##### USING THE DUAL PULSE WELD FUNCTION

Using multiple current pulses increases weld quality. In dual pulse mode
Sunstone welders will fire twice from a single actuation. The first pulse is
used to remove surface inconsistencies and contaminants which helps to
displace oils, break through oxide layers, and seat the welding electrodes.

##### SETTING PULSE 1 AND 2

The Pulse 1 energy setting should be chosen such that the parts adhere
weakly. To determine Pulse 1, turn off Pulse 2 and do a series of test welds
starting at a low pulse energy setting. Increase the pulse energy about 3%
every test until the parts stick together to achieve maximum heat. Pulse 1
energy is typically below 10%. Pulse 2 energy is typically between 50% and
70%. A test weld should be performed and pulled apart to determine weld
strength. A nickel strip to nickel plated steel weld, typically seen in battery
pack manufacturing, should pull apart leaving holes in the thin nickel metal
and leaving the weld nuggets on the battery terminal. Thicker materials
should be pulled with a specific pull force requirement in mind.

##### ENERGY ADJUSTMENT

Each Sunstone welder is fully adjustable between its minimum and maximum
energy. Sunstone Capacitive Dual Pulse welders have weld repetition rates
of up to 600 welds/min. See Table 3 for additional details on weld repetition
rates. The weld energy knob is used to set the total welder energy storage
and is also used to set the peak weld current. The pulse widths are then
adjusted to provide the appropriate weld energy released during each weld.
