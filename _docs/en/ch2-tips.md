##### WELD PRESSURE

Several other factors play a part in the contact resistance. The larger the
contact resistance the hotter the resultant weld. On the micro-scale, contact
resistance is reduced when more metal bridges or contact points are formed
(see *Figure 2*). Using more electrode pressure creates more metal bridges.
This results in a lower contact resistance and a cooler weld. Conversely, light
electrode pressure results in less metal contact, higher resistance, and a
hotter weld. An appropriate amount of pressure should be used to insure
good weld strength.

***FIGURE 2:*** On the micro-scale, surface roughness limits surface-to-surface contact. More contact points result in a lower contact resistance.

##### ELECTRODE CONFIGURATIONS

*Figure 3* shows several electrode configurations used in resistance welding.
*Figure 3a* is called a direct weld. Current is passed from one electrode through
both workpieces and out an opposing electrode. *Figure 3b* shows a step
electrode configuration. This configuration is used when there is access
to only one side of the workpiece and an electrode can be placed on both
materials. *Figure 3c* is a series configuration. Electrodes can only be placed
on one metal surface from one side. Current is divided between the two
parts. This weld configuration requires more weld energy.

##### WELD ENERGY

Sunstone capacitive Dual Pulse welders allow adjustment of the stored
energy via an energy adjustment dial. The energy is then displayed in watt
seconds (Joules) on the front panel.

##### THEORY OF OPERATION - DCD320

The DCD320 precision dynamic capacitive discharge (DCD) spot welder has
two distinct operating modes that operate as two distinct welding power
supplies. In capacitive discharge (CD) mode the DCD320 operates as a
320ws capacitive discharge spot welder. The CD mode internal wave form
characteristics have been designed to better facilitate the welding of steel and
highly resistive parts by “slowing down” the capacitive discharge curve. This
slow down in weld discharge helps prevent weld splash for resistive metals
that a normal capacitive welder would melt too quickly. Conductive metals
are also easily welded in this weld mode (e.g. copper sheet, etc). The CD mode
of the welder also allows very precise energy storage and discharge of the
capacitor banks, down to 0.1ws stored energy. In addition, the pulse widths
of the two welding pulses can be further refined to limit output energies to as
low as 0.01ws per pulse. Because the pulse width and the energy storage are
uncoupled peak welding current and actual energy delivered can be adjusted
to produce unusual welding wave forms. For example *Figure 4* shows a typical
capacitive discharge wave form next to a high current low energy wave form
that can be produced with the DCD320 in CD mode.

energy wave form that can be produced with the DCD320 in CD mode.

Sunstone technology allows the typical CD discharge curve to be broken into
any arbitrary length. This is unique among CD welders. Please note that for
most resistive applications, keeping the peak current high and the discharge
curve long will reduce metal splash and metal expulsion. For conductive
materials a long discharge may also be advantageous, as more energy is
typically required. Please also note that higher weld energies require higher
clamping pressure between parts. This pressure is used as a follow-on force
between the two parts to keep them together during the melting phase of
the weld. As parts melt, surface tension has a tendency to cause a retraction
of the two surfaces away from one another. Without sufficient follow on
pressure to keep the parts in contact, a small gap will develop leading to an
arc and part/electrode damage.

For the DCD320, the DC mode of operation stands for “dynamic capacitive”.
The mode is a hybrid between a capacitive discharge supply and a linear DC
(direct current) type of power supply. The welder utilizes larger internal power
capacitors and large internal power supplies to produce a wave form that
can be constant current for up to 750ms depending on the desired voltage
and weld load. If for example the DC mode is being utilized for a thermocompression
application and a voltage of 4.0V were selected and a time of
100ms were selected the resulting wave form would occur:

***Figure 5:*** A DC “Dynamic Capacitive” discharge curve with a voltage set-point of 4V and a duration of 100ms.

This wave form starts capacitively in nature but then below a threshold
voltage determined by the load resistance of the welding system, the
DC mode will maintain the set-point voltage for the duration of the weld
discharge. For a typical thermo-compression bonding (TCB) electrode the
load will allow for a 2VDC maintained voltage. Any voltages below this load
allowed value would maintain at the set-point voltage. As an example if the
weld settings were 1.5V and 100ms the wave form would take the following
shape:

***Figure 6:*** A DC “Dynamic Capacitive” discharge curve with a voltage set-point of 1.5V and a duration of 100ms.

Different weld properties can be accomplished by utilizing these Dynamic CD
wave form characteristics. For example: When welding enamel coated wire
with a TCB electrode if a slower melting process is desired the voltage would
be lower (perhaps below the 2V threshold) and the time would be longer. If on
the other hand it is desired to weld the wire more quickly but to make sure the
end result of wire compression etc. were controlled precisely, a higher voltage
and shorter time (e.g. 4V and 100ms) might be used. The higher initial heat
created would more effectively burn off the enamel coat while the constant
voltage section of the waveform can be tuned to create the desired wire
compression and bonding.
