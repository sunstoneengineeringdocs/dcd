All Sunstone Products come with a 1 year warranty. Sunstone Engineering
will repair all defects in craftsmanship without charge during this time period
(excluding the cost of shipping). This warranty does not cover damage
caused by improper use of Sunstone products. This warranty does not
include consumable items, such as welding electrodes. Sunstone Engineering
is dedicated to keeping our products operating at peak performance for years
to come. Any repairs needed after the 1 year warranty period are performed
at cost, typically less than $50 USD.

Sunstone Engineering offers a 30 day return policy on all of our products.
Before sending a product back, please contact Sunstone Engineering to
receive an RMA number. The RMA number should appear clearly on the
outside of the package. Customer refunds are accomplished via check.
Please note that a 6% restocking fee will apply to all returns. Equipment
damaged by improper use or insufficient shipping precautions will be charged
additional fees.
