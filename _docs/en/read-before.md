</div>

Consult these symbols and the related instructions listed next to the symbols
for proper action when dealing with these hazards.

##### READ INSTRUCTIONS

<img src="../img/warn_read_manual.png" class="warning-img pull-left"/>

* Read the owner’s manual before using the welder.
* Only personnel trained and certified by the manufacturer should service the unit.
* Use only genuine replacement parts from the manufacturer.
* Never open welder to perform any maintenance operation inside the unit.


##### SAFETY PRECAUTIONS FOR FIRE OR EXPLOSION

<img src="../img/warn_explosions.png" class="warning-img pull-left limit-margin-bottom"/>

There is a possibility that flying sparks, hot work pieces, and/
or hot equipment can cause fires and burns. Ensure that your
work area is clean and safe for welding before starting any
weld job.

* Wear appropriate eye protection at all times while using the welder.
* Do not install or operate unit near combustible surfaces.
* Do not install or operate unit near flammables.
* Do not weld where flying sparks can strike flammable material.
* Remove all flammable materials from the welding area. If this is not possible, tightly cover them with approved covers.
* Protect yourself and others from flying sparks and hot metal.
* Do not weld where the atmosphere may contain flammable dust, gas, or vapors.
* Remove any combustibles, such as butane lighters or matches, from your person before doing any welding.
* Watch for fire and keep a fire extinguisher nearby.
* Do not overload your building’s electrical wiring – be sure the power distribution system is properly sized, rated, and protected to handle this unit.
* Do not exceed the equipment’s rated capacity.
* Use only correct fuses or circuit breakers. Do not oversize or bypass them.

##### SAFETY PRECAUTIONS FOR ELECTRICAL SHOCK

<img src="../img/warn_electrical_shock.png" class="warning-img pull-left limit-margin-bottom"/>

Sunstone capacitive single pulse welders are equipped with
universal power supplies and can be used with both
110/220V AC wall power. No voltage selection is required
prior to connecting and powering on the welder. The welder
will detect the voltage, and make the appropriate adjustments automatically.
Touching live electrical parts can cause fatal shocks or severe burns. The
input power circuit and the internal circuits of the Sunstone welder are live
when the power switch is turned on. Additionally the internal capacitors
remain charged for a period of time after the welder is turned off and/or
power is disconnected. Incorrectly installed or improperly grounded
equipment is a hazard. Do not operate welder in a wet/damp environment.

* Care should be taken not to short across the positive and negative terminals. At full power, the weld current carries thousands of amps and is dangerous if the terminals are accidentally bridged.
* All welds are performed at low voltage for increased safety of operation.
* Do not wear metal jewelry when welding. The terminals are safe to touch without fear of arcing as long as no metal is on your hands.
* When altering or maintaining any part of the welding path (such as swapping electrodes or cables), turn the unit off.
* Do not touch live electrical parts.
* Wear dry, hole-free insulating gloves and body protection.
* Properly install and ground this equipment (refer to the grounding codes and specifications of the area you live in).
* Do not weld with wet hands or wet clothing.
* Always verify the supply ground – check and be sure that the input power cord ground wire is properly connected to a ground terminal in the disconnect box or that the input power cord plug is connected to a properly grounded receptacle outlet. Do not remove or bypass the ground prong.
* Keep cords dry, free of oil and grease, and protected from hot metal and sparks.
* Frequently inspect the input power cord and ground conductor for Dynamic Capacitive Discharge Welder User Manual damage or bare wiring – replace immediately if damaged – bare wiring can kill. Check ground conductor for continuity.
* Turn off all equipment when not in use.
* Use only well-maintained equipment and repair or replace damaged parts at once.

##### PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FLYING SPARKS AND ARC RAYS

<img src="../img/warn_glasses_required.png" class="warning-img pull-left limit-margin-bottom"/>

It is essential for every person in the immediate work area to
wear/utilize proper Personal Protection Equipment. There is a
possibility that sparks can fly off from the weld joint area;
therefore, take the necessary precautions to avoid trapping a
spark within your own clothing.

* Wear protective garments such as oil-free, flame-resistant leather gloves, heavy shirt, cuff-less trousers, high shoes, and a cap. Avoid synthetic fibers as they melt easily.
* Use an approved face shield or safety goggles with side shields when welding or when observing others performing welds.

##### SAFETY PRECAUTIONS FOR HOT METAL AND CABLES

<img src="../img/warn_hot_to_touch.png" class="warning-img pull-left limit-margin-bottom"/>


Welding material that has a high thermal conductivity will
cause metal to heat rapidly. Repetitive welds in the same
location can also cause metal to heat rapidly.

* Avoid touching weld spots immediately after the weld has been performed as they will be hot.
* Do not touch hot weld areas barehanded.
* Allow sufficient cooling time before handling welded pieces.
* Welding cables can become extremely hot. After extended use, be cautious when handling the weld cables.

##### SAFETY PRECAUTIONS FOR FUMES AND GASES

<img src="../img/warn_fumes.png" class="warning-img pull-left limit-margin-bottom"/>

Welding can produce fumes and gases. Breathing these
fumes and gases can be hazardous to your health. Sunstone
welders produce minimal fumes and gases when compared
to large-scale welders. Though not required, some form of
ventilation is recommended.

* Keep fumes away from face.
* Do not breathe the fumes.
* Ventilate the area and/or use local forced ventilation at the weld
spot to remove welding fumes.
* If ventilation is poor, wear an approved air-supplied respirator.
* Read and understand the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and
the manufacturer’s instructions for metals, consumables, coatings,
cleaners, and degreasers.
* Do not weld in locations near degreasing, cleaning, or spraying
operations. The heat and rays of the weld can react with vapors to
form highly toxic and irritating gases.
* Do not weld on coated metals, such as galvanized, lead, or
cadmium-plated steel, unless the coating is removed from the weld
area, the work area is well ventilated, and the operator is wearing
an air-supplied respirator. The coatings and any metals containing
these elements can give off toxic fumes if welded.

##### SAFETY PRECAUTIONS FOR FALLING EQUIPMENT

<img src="../img/warn_heavy_equip.png" class="warning-img pull-left"/>

* Use a working surface of adequate physical strength to support the welding unit during operation or storage.
* Secure welding unit during transport so that it cannot tip or fall.

##### MAGNETIC FIELDS CAN AFFECT IMPLANTED MEDICAL DEVICES

<img src="../img/warn_electromagnetic_noise.png" class="warning-img pull-left"/>

* Wearers of pacemakers and other implanted medical devices should keep away.
* Implanted medical device wearers should consult their doctor and the device manufacturer before going near arc welding, spot welding, gouging, plasma arc cutting, or induction heating operations.

##### OVERUSE CAN CAUSE OVERHEATING

<img src="../img/warn_hot_equip.png" class="warning-img pull-left"/>

* Allow a cooling period between strenuous welding schedules; follow rated duty cycle.
* If overheating occurs often, reduce duty cycle before starting to weld again
