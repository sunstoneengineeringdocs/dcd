The D-CD320 offers both thermo-compression bonding technology (DC
waveforms), and capacitive discharge welding technology. Operators can
quickly and easily switch from one mode to the other - saving time and
resources.

In the past, thermo-compression bonding processes yielded a large number
of failures caused by weak wire bonds. Now, Sunstoneâ€™s high-tech products
provide a guaranteed solution for improving thermo-compression bonding
processes by providing reliable bonds and repeatable manufacturing
processes.

* Two Welding Technologies
* DC and CD Waveforms
* Dual Pulse Capabilities
* Fine Control of Low Energies

Weld nugget formation (picture) takes place during the first few milliseconds
of the welding process. A CD welder allows extremely fast energy release
with large peak currents. More of the energy goes into weld formation and
less into heating surrounding material. The heat-affected zone, where rapid
heating and cooling have changed the properties of the metal, is localized to
a small area around the weld spot. The quick discharge rate of CD welders
also allows electrically and thermally conductive materials, such as copper or
aluminum, to be welded. Capacitive welders deliver repeatable welds even
during line voltage fluctuations because weld energy is stored before use
