##### The Thermo-compression Process

Thermo-compression bonding (TCB) has several important considerations
to produce a strong and repeatable joint. Outlined below are the important
phases in a thermo-compression bonding process.

		 	<i>1.</i> Before the weld takes place, the enamel coated wire (or uncoated wire if desired) should be placed under the thermocompression tip. The joint between the two electrode sides is the best location for most effective heating.

			<i>2.</i> During a thermo-compression bond the heat to produce the weld is created at the electrode tip (where the two sides of the electrode touch). The heat first removes the enamel of polymer coat via evaporation or melt-back, and then the heat is transferred via electrode pressure to melt the copper wire and substrate. This process can happen in two stages depending on the wire coating and wire diameter. The first stage could be pulse 1 being used to remove the enamel coat. The second pulse could then be used to create the actual wire to substrate bond. However, many wires will allow the removal of the enamel and the bond to take place in only one pulse. In this case turn off the first pulse (pulse 1) and only use pulse 2. This entire process takes around 100ms of time for a typical enamel coated wire. Please note that best results are typically achieved for 31AWG wire and above (smaller wire).

			<i>3.</i> The electrode will then cool the weld joint to solidify the weld. This process takes around 50-100ms of time. Typically this will occur without the operatorâ€™s conscious knowledge directly after the weld.

			<i>4.</i> The section of wire under the electrode has been flattened. Depending on the electrode shape the wire can be made to break off easily on one side (see examples below).

As shown in *figure 10* the
thermo-compression
electrode can be shaped to
help with wire strain relief
or to help move excess wire after the welding process. *Figure 10a* shows a
slanted electrode that will produce good strain relief on one side of the wire
and a weak point on the other side for easy wire break off. *Figure 10b* shows a
flat electrode that could be used if the wire did not need strain relief or if the
wire was intended to continue on to a subsequent weld. For most applications
the *Figure 10a* type of electrode is recommended. This weld shape will also
have a stronger bond than a flat electrode because of the deeper electrode
penetration on the wedge point.

As shown in *Figure 11*, weld geometry makes a large difference in wire
weldability. As shown in the first diagram, enamel coated wire to a thin
PCB pad will be a simple weld. The thin PCB pad is unable to transfer the
TCB generated heat away and this helps the melting and bonding process.
However, the second diagram shows and large copper base for the weld
substrate.

***Figure 11:*** A thermocompression bond (TCB) will be easy or difficult depending on the mass and conductivity of the part and wire.

Key tips for thermo-compression bonding:

* Thicker/larger base material is more efficient at transferring away the TCB generated heat.
* This means that more heat must be added, and added more quickly, to facilitate the welding process for thicker/larger base substrates.
* Please note that a large PCB pad will require more energy than a small PCB pad or trace for the above reasons.
