Sunstone’s micro welding solutions are perfect for micro-joining and
thermo-compression bonding. When bonding small wires from one
connection pad to another, Sunstone’s new D-CD320 - dual function thermocompression
bonding and capacitive discharge welder, in combination with
low-force micro weld heads, are recommended as the optimal setup for
thermo-compression bonding applications.

The D-CD welder has many advantages over other types of welders. One
such advantage is the ability to achieve a quick energy release, which can
result in successfully welding highly conductive metals such as copper. Also,
this quick energy release is very concentrated at the weld spot, thus creating
a very small heat-affected zone. Having a small heat-affected zone means
that delicate projects and heat sensitive applications can be welded without
jeopardizing or damaging the welded pieces.

Some typical applications welded with Sunstone D-CD320 are:

* Thermo-compression and Micro-joining Bonding
* Magnet Wire Welding
* Enamel Coated Wires
* Wire to Chip Welds
* Re-flow Soldering
* Fine Wires and Ribbons

The Sunstone D-CD spot welder is the most effective, precision fine-spot
resistance welder on the market.
