title: "What is Capacitive Discharge Resistance Welding?"
---

Capacitive discharge resistance welding uses capacitors to store energy for
quick release.



Capacitive resistance welders, also called capacitive discharge or CD welders,
have many advantages over other welder types:

* Quick energy release for welding highly conductive metals such as copper.
* Small heat effected weld zones.
* Repeatable energy release independent of line voltage fluctuations.
* Capable of extremely fine energy adjustment.

Weld nugget formation (picture) takes place during the first few milliseconds
of the welding process. A CD welder allows extremely fast energy release
with large peak currents. More of the energy goes into weld formation and
less into heating surrounding material. The heat-affected zone, where rapid
heating and cooling have changed the properties of the metal, is localized to
a small area around the weld spot. The quick discharge rate of CD welders
also allows electrically and thermally conductive materials, such as copper or
aluminum, to be welded. Capacitive welders deliver repeatable welds even
during line voltage fluctuations because weld energy is stored before use.

##### WELD FORMATION

Spot welding relies on metal resistivity (resistance) to heat and fuse metal.
A large current is passed through the workpiece metal. Energy is dissipated
due to metal resistance in the form of heat which melts and fuses the weld
materials. There are two phases to the melting process. The welder must
overcome both the material contact resistance and the bulk resistance of the
material.

Below, *Figure 2* shows an example of a micro-scale surface profile.
On the micro-scale, material surfaces are rough and only contact in a limited number
of locations. In the first few milliseconds of weld formation, the highresistance
metal bridges melt, allowing other bridges to come into contact to
continue the melting process. When all of the bridges have fused, the contact
resistance is zero. The bulk resistance of the metal then plays the final role in
the weld formation.
