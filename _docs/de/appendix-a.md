***AWG:*** American Wire Gauge is the standardized wire gauge system.  
***FAYING:*** Faying surfaces are those that have been joined by a weld.  
***PULSE:*** A burst of electrical energy.  
***RESISTANCE:*** Welders rely on a resistance between its terminals to generate the heat needed to melt metals. Ohm’s law states that Voltage = Current X Resistance.  
***SPOT WELD:*** A small weld done with two electrodes that leaves a circular (or spot) shaped weld nugget.  
***TERMINALS:*** The copper bars protruding from the case marked with a ‘+’ and ‘-’ are the terminals.
